# Automation-Assessment
Automated testing assessment using Cucumber with the google chrome driver and extent reports.

The progress of the assessment is as follows:
- All tests passed succesfully
- Extent report generated, however only the last one. I think this is an issue to do with the location of flush()
- Excel reporting feature not used as ran out of time.
